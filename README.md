# Flint Steel

### Disclosure
This is a fork of [Fabric Loom](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loom) removing a lot of the Fabric Mods logic and adapted for use with Flint Loader.
We use it primarily to provide a minecraft dev environment. All libraries used by this plugin have been mirrored to our maven, so we don't cause unnecessary bandwidth usage and costs for the Fabric MC team.

This project is NOT endorsed by or affiliated with Fabric, and you cannot use it to develop fabric mods!

***

A [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) plugin to setup a deobfuscated development environment for Minecraft mods. Primarily used in the Flint Loader toolchain.

* Has built in support for tiny mappings (Used by [Yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn))
* Utilises the Fernflower and CFR decompilers to generate source code with comments.
